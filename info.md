# Report

Building this project, the most challenging part for me was aquiring access to a proper developement environment.
It took most of my time to set it up. I had around 10 hours to the deadline when my setup was finally ready.
Most of the code is AI-generated. Also having a time constraint, I tried to use the pareto principle for decision making. Keeping the software architecture, ui and code as simple and minimal as possible. For example I tryed not to use framework as much as possible. I wanted to add a tool for the agent to know the current time but I didn't have enough time.

# Possible improvements

There is a lot of room for context engineering. 
The UI can be improved.
The agent workflow can be improved in several ways. The part of the agent that validates queries can be made to use llms. 
Other tools and capabilities can be added. 
Memory of the agent can be improved. 
Also more safeguards around model behaviour can be added.


Thanks for your time and attention.
